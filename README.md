# IoT-based-Weather-Monitoring-System

Our project aims to develop an IoT-based weather monitoring system using an ESP8266 module to collect data on various environmental parameters such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity.

The system is designed to provide real-time updates on the weather conditions. The data collected from advanced electronic sensors will be transmitted wirelessly to an IoT cloud service, namely Thingspeak. This cloud platform will serve as a repository for storing and analyzing the gathered data, enabling continuous monitoring and detailed analysis of weather patterns and environmental changes over time.

This project contributes to the advancement of IoT applications in weather monitoring,offering valuable insights into local weather conditions and facilitating informed decision-making based on accurate and timely data.
